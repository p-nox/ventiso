Backend Microservices Portfolio Project

This project is a backend application built with Spring Boot microservices architecture. It demonstrates practical skills in developing modular, scalable services with key technologies like JWT for authentication, Apache Kafka for asynchronous messaging, Redis for caching, and Eureka for service discovery.

Core features include user authentication, favorites management, real-time chat, search filters, and notifications. The project uses RESTful APIs with MySQL database integration.

Designed as a portfolio to showcase expertise in modern backend development, microservices patterns, and event-driven communication.

Future plans include Kubernetes deployment, advanced security, and monitoring enhancements.
